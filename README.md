# Mobile-Price-Range-Classification-ML-Project-
This project predicts the price range (0 to 3) of mobile phones based on their specifications using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. The goal is to build and compare models, tune them using GridSearchCV, and evaluate their accuracy.
About Dataset
  Context
  Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies
  like Apple,Samsung etc.He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company
  creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To
  solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.Bob wants
  to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory
  etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help
  to solve this problem.
  In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how
  high the price is.

  Final Results

    Logistic Regression97.5%
    Tuned SVM92.75%
    Random Forest89.2%
    
  ðŸ“Œ Conclusion: Logistic Regression performed best on this dataset. This suggests that the
     features are well-separated and a linear model is sufficient for high accuracy.
  
ðŸ“¤ Final Test Predictions

  The best model was used to predict values on the unseen test dataset. These predictions can
  be used for further submission or validation.
