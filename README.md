# Mobile-Price-Range-Classification-ML-Project-
This project predicts the price range (0 to 3) of mobile phones based on their specifications using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. The goal is to build and compare models, tune them using GridSearchCV, and evaluate their accuracy.
